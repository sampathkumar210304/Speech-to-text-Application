# Speech-to-text-Application
🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Speech to Text Converter! 🎙️
I'm thrilled to announce that I’ve successfully created a "Speech to Text Converter" -Project-1 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🌐💻
This project enables real-time voice recognition and converts speech into text dynamically. It was a rewarding experience that not only strengthened my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of browser APIs like webkitSpeechRecognition.
I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Vijay Kumar for his guidance and support throughout my learning journey, as well as to Udemy for providing such valuable resources and insights that helped bring this idea to life. 🙌
